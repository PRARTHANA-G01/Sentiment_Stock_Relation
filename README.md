It is well-suited for analyzing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments in tweets and other social media content, making it ideal for this projectâ€™s sentiment analysis needs.

### Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is used to study and identify trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclic behaviors in historical stock prices. 
Techniques such as moving averages, autoregression, and differencing are applied to make the data stationary, an essential step for effective time series forecasting and analysis.

### Random Forest
The Random Forest classifier, an ensemble machine learning method, is applied to predict stock price movement.
By training on sentiment and stock price data, the Random Forest model can learn to recognize complex patterns in the data, providing robust predictions on the direction of stock prices.
